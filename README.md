## Introduction
This repo contains the programming assignments I completed as part of the [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). Note that I have uploaded these notebooks partly as a reference for myself and as a record of my work. These notebooks will *not* run on your local machine without the utils files and data provided by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). No programming assignments exist for Course 3 - Structuring Machine Learning Projects - however in addition to this repo containing my programming assignments, it also contains the written notes I made whilst taking this specialization.
